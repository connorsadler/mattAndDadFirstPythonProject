Connors chat room demo
Enhanced version of the chat room that Matthew Raaff has found and we've been playing with

To run:
1. Run the server file: Chat room.py
2. Run a client: Chat client.py
3. Run another client: Chat client.py

All 3 must be running concurrently, the server started first
You can then chat from one client to another
